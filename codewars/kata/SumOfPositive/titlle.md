# This JavaScript function positiveSum takes an array arr as an input.

The function uses the reduce method on the array arr to iterate over its elements and reduce it to a single value, which is the sum of all positive numbers in the array.

The reduce method takes two arguments:

a callback function that specifies how to calculate the reduced value, and
an initial value (in this case, 0).
The callback function takes two parameters: sum and current.
sum is the accumulated value that gets updated on each iteration, and current is the current element being processed.

The callback function uses a ternary operator ? : to determine whether current is positive or not. If current is positive, it adds it to sum, otherwise it adds 0.

Finally, the reduce method returns the final reduced value, which is the sum of all positive numbers in the arr, and the positiveSum function returns this value as its result.
